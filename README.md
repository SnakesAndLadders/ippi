# ippi
IP testing tool written in Python.  Works great on RPI 3 with a 3.5 inch screen, but will work just as well on any Debian based system

## Io Install:
After cloning or downloading run 
```
setup.bat
```
To install all dependencies. Then it is as simple as running 
```
./ippi cli
```
for the cli, or 
```
./ippi gui
```
for the gui!
